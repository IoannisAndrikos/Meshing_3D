-----------Meshing_3D-----------

-----------the solution contains two projects:
		1) Meshing_3D -> contains all the functionality (is a static library .lib file)
		2) UnitTesting -> contains the unit tests (is an executable .exe file)

//TO DO:

-----------ThirdParty libraries (necessary installation, link project to them):
		1) OpenCV -> manage efficiently the 2D and 3D points
		2) Visualization toolkit (VTK) -> perform computational geometry operations
