## Meshing 3D.

**Projects**

1. all functionalities are in **Meshing_3D** (is a static library .lib file)
2. the unit test are in **UnitTesting** (is an executable .exe file)

**Third Party libraries:**

	1. OpenCV -> manage efficiently the 2D and 3D points
	2. Visualization toolkit (VTK) -> perform computational geometry operations

**TODOs:**

	1. Install both OpenCV and VTK
	2. Link soluntion procejts to the them
	3. Change the paths in UnitTesting/test.cpp with your local environment paths
	4. Run tests

**Depends on :**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project do heavily depends on:

		1. Visualization toolkit (VTK) >= 9.0.3
		2. OpenCV >= 4.5.1
